# Little physics game demo with three.js and cannon.js

## Term Project of CG course
Achieved a simple game demo using [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and [cannon.js](https://github.com/schteppe/cannon.js).

Still some bugs but seems fun.

## A simple game!

Clike [here](https://weatheringwithu.github.io/Little-Physics-Demo/) to view demo.

## Instructions:
Press Up/Down/Left/Right Arrow to move the cannon.

Press A/D to control the direction of the cannon.

Press W/S to control the ball shooting direction, Q/E to change the ball speed.

Press F to fire and R to reset.

Press SPACE to change the simulation step.(you can get a nearly pause effect)

You can use Mouse and CTRL to rotate/move the scene and change other things through dat_gui.

Have fun!
